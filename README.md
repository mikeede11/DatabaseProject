# DatabaseProject

This is a simple database complete with file management, log management, and buffer management for read/write optimization.
It includes Transaction functionality complete with concurrency management and recovery algorithms to ensure transactional correctness.
Fundamentally it provides query functionality with Select, Product, Project and Update Scans so the user can retrieve and modify the data they want easily.
Lastly, a functional lexer and Parser is included, yet not integrated with the database. Enjoy!
