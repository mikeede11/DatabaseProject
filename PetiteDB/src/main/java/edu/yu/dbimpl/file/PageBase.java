/** Specifies the public API for the Page implementation by requiring all
 * Page implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * A Page represents the main-memory region used to hold the contents of a
 * block, and thus is used by the FileMgr in tandem with a BlockId A Page can
 * hold three value types: ints, strings, and "blobs" (i.e., arbitrary arrays
 * of bytes).  A client can store a value at any offset of the page but is
 * responsible for knowing what values have been stored where.  The result of
 * trying to retrieve a value from the wrong offset is undefined.
 *
 * The design for storing values of a given type is discussed in lecture and
 * MUST BE FOLLOWED in your implementation (see the Javadoc on maxLength()
 * below).
