/** Specifies the public API for Layout implementation by requiring all Layout
 * implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * A Layout encapsulates and augments the record "logical schema" meta-data
 * (name, type, length) provided by SchemaBase with per-field offset
 * information, and augments this information with "physical schema" meta-data
 * such as "offsets" and "slot size".  In contrast with the logical view
 * presented by the SchemaBase, a Layout presents a physical view.  Thus the
 * "length" of an int field does have meaning for Layout, even though it's
 * undefined for SchemaBase.
 *
 * The first 4 bytes of the record MUST BE the "in-use/empty" flag.  All records
 * fields MUST BE layed out in the order that the client invoked addField.
 * Aside from this requirement, layout offsets are implementation dependent
 * because field order is implementation dependent.  Only the sum of the
 * offsets ("slotSize") must be the same across implementations.
 *
 * The implementation MUST assign the offset of field #i+1 to be located at the
 * location at which field #1 ends: i.e., a fixed-length layout with no extra
 * padding.
 *
 * NOTE: Layout is conceptually a "value class", with all implications
 * concomitant thereto.
