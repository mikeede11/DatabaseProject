/** Specifies the public API for the ConcurrencyMgr implementation by requiring
 * all ConcurrencyMgr implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * In this design, every transaction is associated with its own concurrency
 * manager.  This concurrency manager design assumes a lock-based approach to
 * concurrency control: the concurrency manager keeps track of which locks the
 * transaction currently has, and interacts with the global lock table as
 * needed.
 *
 * Design note: the resetAllLockState() method implicitly assumes that the DBMS
 * is using a lock-based concurrency control implementation.  This restriction
 * should be cleaned up in subsequent iterations.
