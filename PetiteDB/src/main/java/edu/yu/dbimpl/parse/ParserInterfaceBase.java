/** Defines a "black box" set of functionality that must be supported by a
 * PetiteDB parser.  The word "interface" is included in the class name despite
 * the fact that it's not formally an interface (see design note below).
 *
 * Clients can use this class to (only) parse sub-clauses in the PetiteDB
 * grammar (e.g., a Term or Expression).  If a client's request can be
 * satisfied from the current parser position, the parse MAY NOT throw an
 * exception, must satisfy the request, even if the remainder of the input is
 * not recognized by the grammar.  The problems with the input will only
 * manifest if the client continues to request PetiteDB clauses that can't be
 * satisfied subsequently.

 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way!.
 *
 * Design note: this class does NOT define the interface to the PetiteDB
 * parser.  I've deliberately not specified such an API in order to give
 * complete implementation freedom.  Instead, this class defines a "results
 * oriented" API: given a String to parse, does your parser construct the
 * correct return type (or, if necessary, throw BadSyntaxException)
 *
 * Design note: as a "results oriented" API, this class isn't responsible for
 * determining whether the overall input is valid.  Rather: given the current
 * state of the parsing in the input, determine whether the specified SQL
 * constructed can be parsed from the remaining portion of the input.
 *
 * Semantics note: the parser and lexer should fail-early-and-fatally after
 * throwing a BadSyntaxException.  Do not try to recover from the error, let
 * the client fix it and try again.  The behavior of subsequent API invocations
 * on the input by this parser or lexer instance is undefined.
